I chose it from a list of books I was able to get for 99 cents with a Special Offer on my <a title="Kindle 3G and Wi-Fi with Special Offers" href=":posts:00001">Kindle</a>. My wife had read it before and she liked it, so I figured I'd give it a try. I started with the sample from Amazon to try it out before actually buying it and I was hooked right from the start.

The book's strange and crazy circus characters make it a very entertaining read. The love relationship adds extra drama to the story, while the present day scenes give some sadness and mirth to getting old. You get to see an inside look at traveling circuses during the Depression era and the Prohibition. The ending has a pleasant twist which will put a smile on your face.

I liked the book a lot and it became a good distraction from the sci-fi/fantasy books I usually read.
