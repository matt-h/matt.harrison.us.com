title: Now on Jigsaw
categories: [open-source, websites]
description: I have switched the generation of this site to jigsaw
---

This site has been my go to for just trying out new things such as static site generators. I have been using Laravel for about 5 years now fulltime for development. So, I switched this site to be built with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com/).

This allows me to use Laravel style code to work on this site keeping it simple with features that I use every day.
