I have switched the generation of this site to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
I have been watching [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a long time now and love the fast build system in [go](https://golang.org/) over the de-facto static site generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This site has been for a long time using [my own static site generator](/blog/source-code-released.html) but I wasn't putting the effort into maintaining it, so thus the reason to switch over to a well maintained project.

Now, we'll see if I put more time into the site with it in an easy to use build system where I can focus only on content instead of the site itself.
